# safe-haven
Safe Haven is an open source project to help enable Bay Area non-profits provide shelter and services to women in need. The goal of the project is to create a site that can link all of the 9 bay area counties service providers so that they can search for housing needs, special services and for shelters to keep their data up to date.
